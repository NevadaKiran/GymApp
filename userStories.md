USER SHOULD BE ABLE TO
- See a workout schedule upon opening page.

- Each workout should have an edit button so the user can change any part of the workout.

- User should be able to create a new workout, should the user want to workout on weekends, or have a two or three workout day.

- User should be able to delete any of the workouts should the user realize that the user just can't make it.  We are coders not gym rats.

- User should also be somewhat impressed by the understated, yet incredibly visually pleasing layout and colors of the page.

Right now 9am on Thursday I don't know why my console log on my saveWorkout on my apps Js isn't showing.



Looking back at the homework.
Most of the homework was a complete waste of time for me.
I spent hours and hours frustrated, not knowing what I was doing.
I never learned how to do the the tasks.
"Here is the solution to what you couldn't do, you wont have time to review or learn it"
- I think I should have just, instead of moving on the next day to the homework that was due then.  I should have done the homework from the day before, and learned it.
I think I would rather have learned how to code, than to have 'completed the course requirements.'
Better I think to learn how to do one thing, than to not learn how to do two things.

Things that have held me back:
- Impostor's guilt.  
Not stopping and telling the instructors that I don't understand something. Not refusing to move on until I understand what is going on.
Better to drop out, or pick up on a later class and have spent time learning than just frustrated and lost, and trying things that you don't know what they mean, or why you are doing it.


README FILE

# GymApp

# Well, this is weird the previous 'README' had disappeared.
So this will be a creator story then.

[BUGS]
- In Server.js CONTROLLERS need to be above MIDDLEWARE.
  *Not understanding this cost me a whole day of muddling.
- The files in the controllers folder really should be plural.  
  * In theory this doesn't matter.  In practice it avoids confusion.




THINGS I DON'T KNOW:
- How to make DB/Seeds.js show up anywhere?
- Still a little fuzzy on $state and $http
- How to call on the pages in the partials?  
  * How to make clicking on an image take you to another page.
  * I am still fuzzy on 'I made the edit, now it must show up.'
- So much of the routes, in scripts/apps.js and controllers/workoutsController
  * is a mystery to me.
    + When to use 'router.get', vs 'app.get' vs 'function'?


THE MAIN THING I DON'T UNDERSTAND
How is anyone else in the class using the same timeline as me?
How are these other students all of who understand what they are doing not done?
I have no clue what I am doing, I don't understand what I am typing, and I am fixing what I type, going by errors and and stack overflow.
I have to type a get route, and a delete route, and I have now I idea what to put in there.  I am just going to be putting in stuff that i have seen there before, and see if it works, and then adjust from there.  The final result will be something that is vastly different from what I started with.
If I knew this, if I had internalized what all this does, I could type it all out easily.  Presumably no?

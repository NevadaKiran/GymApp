NEW README FILE YAY!
New Readme is going to be more of a traditional Readme file.
(the old "createor stories" is going in a file aptly named)


README
What goes in a readme?
(stuff that your write when you can't figure out why your console.log doesn't show anything?)

GYM APP
This is the gym app for people that just want to see how their workouts are going.  And what workouts they have planned for the future.

LIBRARIES
All the NPM stuff, and more than I was experimenting with.

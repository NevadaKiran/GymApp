# Well, this is weird the previous 'README' had disappeared.
So this will be a creator story then.

[BUGS]
- In Server.js CONTROLLERS need to be above MIDDLEWARE.
  *Not understanding this cost me a whole day of muddling.
- The files in the controllers folder really should be plural.  
  * In theory this doesn't matter.  In practice it avoids confusion.




THINGS I DON'T KNOW:
- How to make DB/Seeds.js show up anywhere?
- Still a little fuzzy on $state and $http
- How to call on the pages in the partials?  
  * How to make clicking on an image take you to another page.
  * I am still fuzzy on 'I made the edit, now it must show up.'
- So much of the routes, in scripts/apps.js and controllers/workoutsController
  * is a mystery to me.
    + When to use 'router.get', vs 'app.get' vs 'function'?


THE MAIN THING I DON'T UNDERSTAND
How is anyone else in the class using the same timeline as me?
How are these other students all of who understand what they are doing not done?
I have no clue what I am doing, I don't understand what I am typing, and I am fixing what I type, going by errors and and stack overflow.
I have to type a get route, and a delete route, and I have now I idea what to put in there.  I am just going to be putting in stuff that i have seen there before, and see if it works, and then adjust from there.  The final result will be something that is vastly different from what I started with.
If I knew this, if I had internalized what all this does, I could type it all out easily.  Presumably no?
